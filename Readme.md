1 Game A Month - January
========================

A game made in Haskell using OpenGL and SDL. I'ts going to be a platformer of some sort.

Downloads

Building

### Requirements

- Make
- [The Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
- [Simple Directmedia Layer](http://www.libsdl.org/)

#### Haskell Packages

- [Haskell OpenGL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenGL)
- [Haskell SDL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/SDL-0.6.4)
- [GLUtil](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLUtil-0.3.0)
- [JuicyPixels](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels)

I also included a cabal file now. Unfortunately I'm new to using them so I'm not sure if what I have is sufficient.
